/* C++ How to Program, 9/E, by Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel.

Solution of exercise 2.24:
(Odd or Even) Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints 
whether itâ€™s odd or even. [Hint: Use the modulus operator. An even number is a 
multiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided 
by 2.]
